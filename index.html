                        Ok, so maybe the "AMAZING" part is a stretch but it got you engaged :)
                        My name is Justin Strait and im using this page to introduce myself to you.
                        I'm a thirty seven year old nerd, born and raised in the 'Heartland of America' also know as Kansas City.  
                        I'm currently working in the infrastructure world as a locate technician for USIC and 1800DIGRITE. I started
                        locating two years ago after working as an industrial coating specialist and Operations Manager for twenty years
                        at a prominent local body shop. I am also currently enrolled in a bootcamp program through
                        the University of Kansas where I am learning full stack web development. This is slightly tough for me because Ive never been a fan of KU lol. 
                        Go MIZZ! I graduate the program in May of 2021 and move onto new things in my career path.

                        I am a truely blessed man. I have a huge, supportive, loving, and happy family. I am lucky enough to be    
                        married to the most beautiful woman in the world! I met my wife Sierra Strait two years ago. We fell head over
                        heels with eachother and started building a new and exciting life together from day one. We have a whole 
                        gaggle of children between the two of us. Our oldest is Leo. He's a varsity swimmer for the Blue Springs Wildcats.
                        We call him the giant because at just fourteen, he's six foot 4 inches tall and one hundred eighty pounds lol.
                        Our second oldest is eleven year old Makayla. Shes a superb artist and studies all forms of arts and crafts from painting, 
                        sketching, sewing, and even making her own jewelery line that we are going to set up on Etsy. Next is our six year old Jaxxon.
                        Hes living his best life in first grade right now. This kid is our energizer bunny. He's always on the go and as witty as they come.
                        Jax always has a punchline for the conversation. Coming in at fourth is Scarlett. She's the most anaylytical three year old you've ever met.
                        Brutally honest and extremely intelligent, quite often you cant believe she just said that lol. She loves
                        playing with her baby sister in her spare time. Last, but definently not least, is Saige. 
                        At only 7 months old, make no mistake, this girly rules the kingdom. Shes proving to be extremely independent and loves to smile. 
                        She adores all her siblings the same as they do her.
